# Release Notes
This section details the new features in version 0.1, the fixed bugs from older versions of the app, as well as current known bugs and missing features expected to be due in version 0.1.
## NEW FEATURES
- Added a search bar for exercises to more easily filter all of the available options
- Added a quick log feature to allow users to quickly input their own exercises instead of choosing from a list
- Added a robust point system to reward users for completing exercises
- Finished challenge functionality so users can complete specific challenges to earn extra points
- Added the ability for users to change their profile pictures
- Updated information displayed on the cards on the home page to better reflect those pages

## BUG FIXES
- Entering in the number of reps for an exercise no longer displays 'NaN' when empty
- Fixed a bug that allowed for users to submit a challenge more than once
- Fixed a naming convention bug that sometimes caused the app to crash when quick selecting an exercise
- Fixed a bug that caused certain exercises to be interpreted as the wrong type, i.e. bench press as cardio

## KNOWN BUGS
- Exercises are dependent on their name instead of a unique ID, so a 'Push-Up' is different from a 'Pushup'
- Exercises in the 'Quick Picks' section are not always in the global exercise list
- The search bar on the Add Friends page sometimes autocorrects input and causes a light crash
- The recent tab on the friends page renders people in sections even though there are no defined sections

## MISSING FEATURES
- All earned points are considered 'all-time' and there is no deeper granularity such as daily, weekly, and monthly points
- Users cannot create routines consisting of various exercises and submit it all at once
- The leaderboard cannot be filtered by when points were earned, i.e. 'daily', 'weekly', or 'monthly'
- The settings page does not change any actual settings and is currently just a mock-up. Subsequently, there are no privacy or anonymity settings in the app
- Sign-up and sign-in are restricted to usernames and passwords; there is no functionality to login 3rd party services such as Google
- There is no password recovery in the app
